## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
- Card Layout Design:
The interface uses a card layout to display the title, publication date, article type (learning), and author.
You can learn how to use HTML tags like <div>, <img>, <h2>, <p>, <span>, and <footer> to organize content in a structured way.
- Using CSS for Layout and Styling:
Shadow Effect: The subtle shadow makes the card stand out from the background. You can learn how to use the box-shadow property to create this effect.
Border Radius: The card corners are rounded to give a softer appearance. The border-radius property can be used for this purpose.
Padding & Margin: Learn how to use padding and margin to adjust the spacing between elements within the card.
Colors and Fonts: The interface uses contrasting colors and easy-to-read fonts. You can learn how to coordinate colors and choose appropriate fonts.
- Images and Icons:
Images within the card help create a focal point and relate to the content of the article. You can learn how to insert and align images within the card.
- Typography:
Different font weights, styles, and sizes are used to highlight various parts of the content. You can learn how to use the font-weight, font-size, and line-height properties.
- Responsiveness:
This simple interface can be optimized for different screen sizes, allowing you to learn how to make a design responsive.

### Continued development
I will learn more about complex interfaces, more effective methods for building interfaces, and the application of libraries in projects.
